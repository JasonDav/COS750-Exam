        <h1>COS 750 Exam Activity</h1>
        <h2>Graph Traversal Explained and Illustrated through Breadth-First and Depth-First Traversals.</h2>
        <h3>What is a Graph?</h3>
        <p>A graph is a data structure that contains nodes of data called 'vertices' that are connected to each other via edges.
        <br>The vertices represent data values and can be anything from numbers to letters or addresses or complex data like a social media profile.
        <br>The edges represent connections between these values and can be anything from words to kilometres or something more abstract like a friendship connection.<br>
        Edges can be either directed or un-directed. This defines how the relaionship between the two vertices work. An example of this is a one-way street between two vertices (destinations).
        </p>

        <h3>Why are Graphs important?</h3>
        <p>In computer science graphs are used to represent networks of data, organization of computational devices, as well as visualize and represent complex problems that computers and <br>
        programmers need to solve. Such as the fastest route to a desintation when you open Google Maps. Or how to recommended products for advetisement or friends to suggesting adding because of<br>
        their relation to yourself and your friends. Graphs are an indespensible tool for programmers and without them we would be in a very different world.</p>

        <h3>What is Graph Traversal?</h3>
        <p>Graph Traversal refers to the process of moving along a graph from vertex to vertex via the edges that connect them. Graph Traversal algorithms are algorithms that<br>
        move along the graph either looking for a value (Searching Algorithm) or computing a value or relationship (normal traversal).</p>

        <h3>Graph programming in Python</h3>
        <p>Python is a beginner friendly langauge with a dynamic object system, as such constructing and traversing graphs is not a difficult task for an experience Python developr.<br>
        However, seeing as this course is at a beginner level we will not focus on generating this traversal code ourselves. You can however read more on graph implementations in Python<br>
        and try it out yourself <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Traversal Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Breadth First Search</h3>
        <p>
            Breadth-First Search is a common graph and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> traversal algorithm. It works by exploring each neighbour of a vertex before moving onto the<br>
            neighbours of another vertex. If this doesn't make sense right now, no worries it is illustrated below in the Blockly workspace!<br>
            The pseudo-code for this algorithm is as so:<br>
            <img src="images/bfs-code.png"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Source: Wikipedia</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Depth First Search</h3>
        <p>
            Depth-First Search is also a common graph and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> traversal algorithm. It works by exploring each a neighbour of a vertex until it runs out of neighbours to visit. It then<br>
            backtracks to a vertex with a neighbour it hasn't visited and follows the same pattern as before.
            The pseudo-code for this algorithm is as so:<br>
            <img src="images/dfs-code.png"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Source: Wikipedia</a>
        </p>

        <h2>The Activity</h2>
        <p>
            For this activity an implementation of Breadth-First Search is given in the Blockly Workspace. Click "Run" to see it traverse the graph!<br>
            Your task is to implement the Depth-First Search using the Blockly Workspace and generate the correct Python code. Once you have done that please screenshot the<br>
            blocky code and generated Python and send that to your educator for grading.<br>
            BONUS: Use the generated Python code and a library like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/">Graphviz</a> to create your own graph traversal!
